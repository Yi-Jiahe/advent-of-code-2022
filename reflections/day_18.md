# Part 1

Seems simple enough, just create a set of all the cubes, iterate each cube and count the side if its not adjacent to another cube.
I imagine the challenge is either in part 2 or in a ridiculous number of cubes.

~3000 cubes is not a small amount but with 6 faces a cube its at most ~24000 checks.
