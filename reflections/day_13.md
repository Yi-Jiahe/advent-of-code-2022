# Part 1

Looks like a job for recurssion!

Was browsing through the AOC subreddit and I noticed that most people were using eval or json.loads to parse the input.
I was considering writing a parser but... after learning of the trick I decided against it.
json.loads is pretty safe right?

Spent a bit of time looking though itertools till I found a solution for taking from a list multiple at at time from the itertools reciepes.
I'm not really sure how it works but... it works.

# Part 2

Seems I remembered the convention for comparision functions wrong.
