Fixed some bugs with the templates and generation script given it was the first day they were used for.

# Part 1
I was trying to figure out if there was any neat algorithm to use to decide win or loss.
In the end I just iterated through the possible scenarios because it was simple enough.
A dictionary could probably have worked but the current solution seems easy enough to reason out and not a mess.

# Part 2
Same deal as before, hardcoding the solution was still the simplest and easy enough to reason out so I just did that.
