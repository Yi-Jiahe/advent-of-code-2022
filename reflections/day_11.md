# Part 1

Wow they're getting more and more complicated aren't they.

Parsing the input manually seems easier than parsing it programatically.
But I think it shouldn't be too complicated to do it programmatically.

It was kind of tedious but it worked out in the end.
Debugging the regex was probably good experience.
The hardest part was figuring a way to assign the operation.
I made use of a few cheats based on assumptions made from the input, e.g. test is only division, operation is only + and *.
