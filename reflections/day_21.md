# Part 1

Sounds pretty straightforward.
I'm thinking of having a dictionary of monkey names to numbers/operations for constant time lookup and then just recur through the operations till the root is solved.

# Part 2

Are there values which are used more than once?
If so this could be more complicated.
Otherwise working backwords would be the only challenge.

Fortunately it doesn't seem to be the case.
