# Part 1

I was contemplating writing a set of print grid methods for debugging but I decided against it.
Instead I manaully looked through the result to figure out what was wrong.
I also considered writing the test cases to cover the different types of movements but I was lazy.
Perhaps if this needed to be used again I'll be more diligent in that aspect.

The main holdups I faced were not handling all the cases, especially the no move cases, so test cases would probably have helped.

Oh boy that rope sure got extended.
Fortunately the base code for rope physics was easy enough to extend too.
Naming the varables for the error was probably the hardest bit.
