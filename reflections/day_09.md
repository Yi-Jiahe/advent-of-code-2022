# Part 1

I was contemplating writing a set of print grid methods for debugging but I decided against it.
Instead I manaully looked through the result to figure out what was wrong.
I also considered writing the test cases to cover the different types of movements but I was lazy.
Perhaps if this needed to be used again I'll be more diligent in that aspect.

The main holdups I faced were not handling all the cases, especially the no move cases, so test cases would probably have helped.
