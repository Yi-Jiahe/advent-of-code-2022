# Part 1

The naive solution seems quite easy to implement so long as there's no duplicates.

Unfortunately, a quick scan of the input shows thay there are quite a number of duplicates (~1/3).

With a bit of modification, I managed to implement the naive solution.
Had a bit of trouble with the modulo-ing but otherwise was straightforward.
