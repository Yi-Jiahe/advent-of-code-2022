# advent_of_code_2022

Solutions for Advent of Code 2022 done in Python.

The reason why I chose Python this year is because I wanted to have a language I was comfortable in so that I could finish the challenges without having to devote too much time each day.

I wanted the empahsis this year to be more of a chance to practice problem solving techniques as opposed to learning a new language. At the same time I also wanted to build up the boilerplate code as an extension from previous attempts.

I added in a reflection for each day because I wanted to get into journalling and putting my thoughts into words. I also figured it would help in reminding me of the challenges I faced and learning points.

Notes to self:
- I need a better way to organize the files.
Having separate directories for the code, input, tests and reflections is fine.
However by day 15 or so there are so many files that won't be touched anymore that its hard to find the current day's files.
