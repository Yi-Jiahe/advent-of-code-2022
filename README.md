# advent_of_code_2022

Solutions for Advent of Code 2022 done in Python.

The reason why I chose Python this year is because I wanted to have a language I was comfortable in so that I could finish the challenges without having to devote too much time each day.

I wanted the empahsis this year to be more of a chance to practice problem solving techniques as opposed to learning a new language. At the same time I also wanted to build up the boilerplate code as an extension from previous attempts.

I added in a reflection for each day because I wanted to get into journalling and putting my thoughts into words. I also figured it would help in reminding me of the challenges I faced and learning points.
